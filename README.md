### <div align="center">ABSTRACT:</div>
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
<div align="center">A local weather app that utilizes both the OpenWeatherMap & Google Maps auto-complete APIs. A user can input any US city and get the local weather, along with a 5-day forecast and a King of the Hill's - Boomhauer - inspired, quote that is tonally related to the state of the returned local weather.</div>

### <div align="center">INSTALLATION:</div>
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

### <div align="center">APP PREVIEW:</div>
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### <div align="center">CONTEXT:</div>
<div align="center">DANGOL'WEATHER was a group project written over the course of seven days during our third module and fifth month at Turing. We spent roughly 25 hours writing the application, requiring a bit longer than expected due to our exploration of new technologies (listed below!) within the project.</div>

### <div align="center">LEARNING GOALS:</div>
<div align="center">Primarily, our goals were to further our understanding of building React applications, specifically by way of functional forward programming via components and React hooks. We were also able to write the entire app in TypeScript, which was a first for all four of us. Additionally, we incorporated component UI libraries styled via Tailwind CSS (both of which were also firsts for us üòé), streamlining the creation of reusable, visually consistent components across the app.</div>

### <div align="center">WINS + CHALLENGES:</div>
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
<div align="center">
  <p><strong>WINS: </strong>While navigating a fairly wide range of new technologies, we were successful in remaining committed to the design and functional minimalism that defined our initial vision for the application.</p>

  <p><strong>CHALLENGES: </strong>As a whole, definitely navigating the learning curve that comes with a series of entirely new technologies like TypeScript, component UI libraries, and Tailwind CSS - all while being relatively new to React. Despite the obstacles presented, to navigated the proper documentation to get to where we needed to be and ended up with a succesful finish!</p>
